JPAContainer README
===================

PREREQUISITES

  - Java 6
  - Maven 2.2
  - A working internet connection

EDITING THE CODE IN AN IDE

  JPAContainer currently contains configuration data for NetBeans 6.8, but any
  other IDE that supports Maven should work just fine.

TRYING OUT THE DEMO

  1. Compile and install the entire project:

    $ mvn install

  2. Start the built-in Jetty web server:

    $ cd jpacontainer-demo
    $ mvn jetty:run

  3. Open your favorite web browser and point it to:

    http://localhost:8080/jpacontainer-demo/


More instructions will be added later.
