JPAContainer README
===================

PREREQUISITES

  - Java 5
  - Maven 2.2
  - A working internet connection

CHECKING OUT THE CODE

  The source code is maintained in the Vaadin Subversion repository. To check
  out the latest development version, use the following command:

    $ svn co http://dev.vaadin.com/svn/addons/JPAContainer/trunk JPAContainer

EDITING THE CODE IN AN IDE

  JPAContainer currently contains configuration data for NetBeans 6.8, but any
  other IDE that supports Maven should work just fine.
  
  The actual developmen happens in a project realized from directory:
  jpacontainer-addon-dev. Do no use that project to build releases. It is a 
  an independent hack free maven project that is only used for development 
  and dev builds. It builds the agpl version of the addon.
  
  Release builds are done with jpacontainer-addon project, which draws 
  sources from the dev project. Using that directly in IDE is something you
  do not want to try.
