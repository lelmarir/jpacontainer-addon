JPAContainer README
===================

PREREQUISITES

  - Java 6
  - Maven 2.2
  - A working internet connection

CHECKING OUT THE CODE

  The source code is maintained in the Vaadin Subversion repository. To check
  out the latest development version, use the following command:

    $ svn co http://dev.vaadin.com/svn/addons/JPAContainer/trunk JPAContainer

EDITING THE CODE IN AN IDE

  JPAContainer currently contains configuration data for NetBeans 6.8, but any
  other IDE that supports Maven should work just fine.

    $ mvn install

  2. Start the built-in Jetty web server:

    $ cd jpacontainer-demo
    $ mvn jetty:run

  3. Open your favorite web browser and point it to:
