This is the project that should be used for development. The 
project with name jpacontainer-addon is used to build the 
actual release packages. Sources are used from this project.

This project should be:
 * standoalone
 * easily set up (svn co, cd, mvn install) and for any ide
 * easily testable
 
 Note that this project should not be used for building 
 release files. E.g. license files and headers wont get to the 
 artifacts nor the jars will get signed.. Also this only builds
  ...-agpl-3.0 version for local testing purposes.
 
Leave all major maven haxies to the build projects!

NOTE, pom changes in this project will not get into the release
build project. If e.g. a dependency is changed, the same change
must be done in the packaging project as well.
