 * Interface to be implemented by {@link EntityProvider}s that wish to notify
 * clients (in practice EntityContainers) when their contents change.
 * <p>
 * The EntityProvider should at least notify its listeners of the following events:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An entity is added to the entity provider</li>
 *   <li>An already existing entity is updated</li>
 *   <li>An entity is removed from the entity provider</li>
 *   <li>The contents of the entity provider is changed completely</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This is useful in situations where several EntityContainers share the same
 * entity provider.
