 * classes. Instead of having to first access the {@link Embedded} property of
 * the entity class and then the property, a nested property of the entity class
 * can be accessed directly.
 * <p>
 * For example, if an entity class has an embedded property named <code>address</code>
 * and we want to access the <code>street</code> property, we can access it by
 * using the <code>address.street</code> nested property.
